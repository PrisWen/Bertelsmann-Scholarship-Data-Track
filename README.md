# I've joined the #60DAYSOFUDACITY Challenge

  Today accept the challenge of #60daysofudacity

## Day 1 : December 10 , 2020 | Challenge Starting

**Today's Progress :** In order to complete this challenge I chose to start with a review of the 6 steps of CRISP-DM. I love the way we were introduced to how it works.

**Thoughts :** Hope this will be exciting.

## Day 2 : December 11 , 2020 | Methodology Map

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed the map outlines has two main scenarios for a business problem: Data analysis and  Predictive analysis


**Thoughts :** Methodology map is very useful to determine the appropriate analytical technique

## Day 3 : December 12 , 2020 | Data understanding

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Data Understanding". It is important for proper analysis. 


**Thoughts :** Get familiar with the data!

## Day 4 : December 13 , 2020 | Data preparation

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Data Preparation". These 5 steps are necessary because the data requires some treatment before starting the analysis


**Thoughts :** This step of the methodology is the basis for moving forward

## Day 5 : December 14 , 2020 | Analysis, modeling and validation

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Analysis, modeling and validation". We can use different models to solve a problem and part of the validation helps to identify if we should change the model


**Thoughts :** Try differentent models.

#### VALIDATION

## Day 6 : December 15 , 2020 | Presentation and visualization

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Presentation and visualization". By visualizing we can measure the success of the analysis and it is important to reference the data source


**Thoughts :** We can show visual results on maps

## Day 7 : December 16 , 2020 | Non-predictive Business Problem

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Non-predictive Business Problem". With Methodology Map we can choose which methodology use in order to solve a business problem


**Thoughts :** There are four categories: Geospatial, Segmentation, Aggregation, and Descriptive

## Day 8 : December 17 , 2020 | Classifying Business Problems

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Classifying Business Problems"
Predictive.- To predict a future outcome
Geospatial.- It uses location
Segmentation.- Grouping data together
Aggregation.- Calculating a value across a group
Descriptive.- Summaries of a data sample

**Thoughts :** I loved the examples

## Day 9 : December 18 , 2020 | Data Rich and Data Poor

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Data Rich and Data Poor". If you doesn't have data on what you are trying to predict your data is poor otherwise is data rich


**Thoughts :** It is important to identify your data

## Day 10 : December 19 , 2020 | Numeric & Non-Numeric Outcome

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Numeric & Non-Numeric Outcome". If you want to predict a number, the target is numeric. If you want to predict a category, it is a classification.


**Thoughts :** It is important to practice with real examples to identify whether a numeric or classification model.

Also, today was the first meeting with the study group #sg_spanish I met @susyjam and @Joaquin it was a pleasant meeting

## Day 11 : December 20 , 2020 | Determining Appropiate Models

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Determining Appropiate Models".
If numeric, you should use a continuous or time-based model
If classification, you should use a binary or non-binary model


**Thoughts :** Again I loved the examples

## Day 12 : December 21 , 2020 | Model Selection Assessment and lesson summary

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed Model Selection Assessment and lesson summary.
It was composed of twelve questions that helped me understand which model to apply.


**Thoughts :** Lesson 2 finished!

## Day 13 : December 22 , 2020 | Business Problem

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Business Problem".
There are three questions that we need to answer:
What decision needs to be made?
What information is needed?
What type of analysis is needed to make that decision?

**Thoughts :** If we answer these questions we can solve the problem
