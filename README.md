# Bertelsmann-Scholarship-Data-Track
# I've joined the #60DAYSOFUDACITY Challenge

  Today accept the challenge of #60daysofudacity

## Day 1 : December 10 , 2020 | Challenge Starting

**Today's Progress :** In order to complete this challenge I chose to start with a review of the 6 steps of CRISP-DM. I love the way we were introduced to how it works.

**Thoughts :** Hope this will be exciting.

#### DATA UNDERSTANDING
![ DATA UNDERSTANDING ][D3]

## Day 4 : December 13 , 2020 | Data preparation

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Data Preparation". These 5 steps are necessary because the data requires some treatment before starting the analysis


**Thoughts :** This step of the methodology is the basis for moving forward

#### DATA PREPARATION
![ DATA PREPARATION ][D4]

## Day 5 : December 14 , 2020 | Analysis, modeling and validation

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Analysis, modeling and validation". We can use different models to solve a problem and part of the validation helps to identify if we should change the model


**Thoughts :** Try differentent models.

[D5]: https://github.com/PrisWen/Bertelsmann-Scholarship-Data-Track/blob/main/assets/D5_validation.PNG

#### VALIDATION
![ VALIDATION ][D5]

## Day 6 : December 15 , 2020 | Presentation and visualization

[D7]: https://github.com/PrisWen/Bertelsmann-Scholarship-Data-Track/blob/main/assets/D7_non_predictive.PNG

#### NON-PREDICTIVE BUSINESS PROBLEM
![ NON-PREDICTIVE BUSINESS PROBLEM ][D7]

## Day 8 : December 17 , 2020 | Classifying Business Problems

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Classifying Business Problems"
Predictive.- To predict a future outcome
Geospatial.- It uses location

Descriptive.- Summaries of a data sample

**Thoughts :** I loved the examples

## Day 9 : December 18 , 2020 | Data Rich and Data Poor

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Data Rich and Data Poor". If you doesn't have data on what you are trying to predict your data is poor otherwise is data rich


**Thoughts :** It is important to identify your data

[D9]: https://github.com/PrisWen/Bertelsmann-Scholarship-Data-Track/blob/main/assets/D9_data_poor.PNG

#### DATA POOR
![ DATA POOR ][D9]

## Day 10 : December 19 , 2020 | Numeric & Non-Numeric Outcome

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Numeric & Non-Numeric Outcome". If you want to predict a number, the target is numeric. If you want to predict a category, it is a classification.


**Thoughts :** It is important to practice with real examples to identify whether a numeric or classification model.

Also, today was the first meeting with the study group #sg_spanish I met @susyjam and @Joaquin it was a pleasant meeting

![ NUMERIC AND NON-NUMERIC ][D10]

## Day 11 : December 20 , 2020 | Determining Appropiate Models

**Today's Progress :** Today I reviewed "Determining Appropiate Models".
If numeric, you should use a continuous or time-based model
If classification, you should use a binary or non-binary model


**Thoughts :** Again I loved the examples
