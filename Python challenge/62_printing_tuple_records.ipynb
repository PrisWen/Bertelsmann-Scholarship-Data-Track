However, this travel planner doesn’t need the degree of precision that the computer has provided; it’s enough for us to have two digits after the decimal point. \n",

    "Each name should be printed in a 10-character field, and the time should be printed in a 5-character field, with one space character of padding between each of the columns.\n",
    "Travel time should display only two digits after the decimal point, which means that even though the input for Xi Jinping’s flight is 10.603 hours, the value displayed should be 10.60."
