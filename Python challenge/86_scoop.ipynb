    "If you’re going to be programming with objects, then you’ll be creating classes—lots of classes. Each class should represent one type of object and its behavior. You can think of a class as a factory for creating objects of that type—so a Car class would create cars, also known as “car objects” or “instances of Car.” Your beat-up sedan would be a car object, as would a fancy new luxury SUV.\n",
    "In this exercise, you’ll define a class, Scoop, that represents a single scoop of ice cream. Each scoop should have a single attribute, flavor, a string that you can initialize when you create the instance of Scoop.\n",
    "Once your class is created, write a function (create_scoops) that creates three instances of the Scoop class, each of which has a different flavor (figure 9.1). Put these three instances into a list called scoops (figure 9.2). Finally, iterate over your scoops list, printing the flavor of each scoop of ice cream you’ve created."
